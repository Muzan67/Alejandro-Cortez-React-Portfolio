        I have enrolled in Columbia University's Engineering Coding Boot Camp to
        transition as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. The knowledge and
        experience I am developing in this bootcamp will provide the
        fundamentals to the vast array of technologies, languages, frameworks,
        and the processes behind them.
